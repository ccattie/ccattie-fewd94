			<p id="blog1" class="blog"> Identifying new trustees for your board of directors is one of the most important functions any nonprofit board performs. And with nearly 2 million board seats opening up in this country every year, board recruiting can be challenging. For that reason, many nonprofits opt to turn to board recruiting services like BoardAssist for help. Choosing the best board recruiting service for your nonprofit is critical. What questions should you be asking as you think through who will perform the very important function of board recruiting for you?  <br> <br>

			Top Ten Questions to Ask when Choosing a Board Recruiting Service <br> <br>
			 

			1. Is the service a nonprofit 501c3 itself?<br><br>

			Many services are not.  Ones that aren’t 501c3 nonprofits might provide a terrific service but their primary purpose may not be to serve the nonprofit community.  Where does their money come from? At BoardAssist, a large part of our funding come from nonprofit foundations who value how we support their grantees.  Is the service you are evaluating paid by a corporation to place their employees on boards?  Does this create the wrong incentives?  Instead of focusing on finding you the perfect board member, are they focused on placing their client’s employees.  BoardAssist views their client as the nonprofit.  For-profit services often view someone else (such as the company paying them) as their client and as such, their primary focus will be on serving someone other than you. <br><br>

			2. Is the service based in the city where you are located?<br><br>

			The nonprofit business is certainly global in the 21st century, and while a service located in a different city than where your board meets might be terrific, we believe there is no way they can have the candidate base knowledge, access and expertise a well-established local player would have. BoardAssist has over 20,000 NYC candidates in our database.  We thinks its important to work with the service that knows, and can deliver for you, the top candidates in your city.<br><br>

			3. How long has the service been in existence?<br><br>

			BoardAssist has been serving the nonprofit community since early 2001.  Across the US there are a number of services that have been helping our community for even longer. Younger services may try to make it appear they have been in the board search business longer than they have.  One quick check is to look up the principals on LinkedIn.  Do they list 2 jobs during the same time period? Perhaps they had another full time job while building their new board matching service so they haven’t really been in this space full time as long as you might have thought. Is board recruiting a new service that an older organization has just begun providing?  How long have they actually been doing board recruiting in your city?<br><br>

			4. What are the credentials of the individuals who will be performing your search?<br><br>

			Board recruiting is a challenging task.  Its important to find a service that will designate someone you fully trust to perform for you and your board. Look up the person who will be working on your search on LinkedIn. Don’t settle for just reviewing the bio that service’s website provides. Do they have board search experience? Or just nonprofit sector or governance experience generally?  BoardAssist’s Executive Director has been in the search space since 1995.<br><br>

			5. Does the service publish their rates online?<br><br>

			Many services choose to negotiate their board recruiting fees on a case by case basis.  Are you confident you are paying the same rate as others who have used that service?  What reason does the service give for not being fully transparent and publishing their rates online?<br><br>

			6. Does the service track how their candidates have performed once recruited for a board?<br><br>

			BoardAssist surveys annually to see how our candidates are performing.  Have they stayed on the board where placed?  Have they met their financial commitment?  Over half our placements serve for at least 5 years with over 90% serving as leaders within 12 months of being placed.  And the majority generate a multiple of what they financially pledged with our average candidate generating over $75,000 for the board he/she joins.  Does the service you are considering track metrics such as these and others that are important to you?<br><br>

			7. Does the service provide a relatively comprehensive list of past nonprofits they have helped?<br><br>

			Is the service fully transparent in disclosing who they have supported in the past?  Or do they provide a short sample of some boards they have helped?  What reason do they give if they won’t provide a full historical client list? Is the client list specific as to who they have helped with board recruiting, or does it include nonprofits the service has helped with board trainings and other services? <br><br>

			8. How involved is the service beyond simply identifying candidates for you?<br><br>

			Some services simply list your board opening on their website.  Do they screen candidates to ensure they meet the board requirements you have specified (including being able to meet  the financial commitment expected annually)?  Do they stay involved once they identify a candidate for you, making sure the interview process is moving along?  Do they help you “close” the candidate when you get to the offer stage ensuring that the time your board spent with the candidate leads to a successful nomination?<br><br>

			9. Is board matching the primary service this provider offers?<br><br>

			There are loads of terrific nonprofit support services that offer a wide range of services to the nonprofit community.  At BoardAssist, our sole focus is supporting the nonprofit community with board member recruitment.  If the service you are considering also focuses on candidate training, board mediations, and development work, for example, how much of their expertise is really in board development? What percentage of their time do they spend on board recruiting?<br><br>

			10.  Will the service allow you to work with other board recruiting services simultaneously?<br><br>

			Board recruiting is tough.  Your nonprofit needs to use every resource it can to find the best possible new trustees for your team.  We believe strongly that our top priority should be to ensure that your needs are met.  If there is an additional service you can use while also working with BoardAssist, we encourage working with them as well.  Board matching services that have your best interests at heart should feel the same way.<br><br>

			<li id="blog2" class="bloglist"> <h2>Why Joining a Board is Great for Your Career</h2> </li>

			<p id="blog2" class="blog"> We know our blog readers are interested in “being the change” they want to see in the world and giving back, but sometimes its hard to find time to do just that with all the demands from work. Our argument for making time: joining a board is great for your career.  You’ll have a chance to be an agent of change and give back, but also do yourself a great service. For more on why, see what this week’s guest blogger Alyssa Gelbard had to say. <br><br>

			 

			Why Joining A Board Is Great For Your Career<br><br>

			You’ve heard that a board role can be highly beneficial for your career. You’ve been told that whether it’s for a non-profit organization or corporate entity, serving on a board can provide professional growth opportunities and strengthen your personal brand. However, since pursuing a board role may require a considerable investment of time and effort – is the payoff worth it? Yes, because a board position enables professional development and personal growth, ultimately fueling career advancement. Here are some ways a board position can help you:<br><br>

			 

			Strengthen your professional credibility <br><br>

			Selection for a board position shows that an organization is entrusting you with a vital, visible and high-impact role. It is a public endorsement of your expertise and value. This affiliation is one you can communicate and promote, and it can raise your professional profile among your peers, within your organization and across your industry. Your board affiliation can also enhance the brand and reputation of the organization for which you work. All of these things can help strengthen your candidacy for a promotion or new role and can increase your value in the workplace.<br><br>

			 

			Grow your professional network<br><br>

			Board roles provide you with an incredible opportunity to meet influential, intelligent and well-connected people. You may meet an organization’s strategic partners, its clients and investors, as well as colleagues and leaders across industries and government. As you meet new people, be sure to connect in meaningful ways; relationships are not built on a single conversation. Cultivate them by setting up calls/meetings, sharing resources, making plans to meet at another event, and of course, connecting on LinkedIn. These relationships can be quite valuable when you are ready to pursue the next step in your career.<br><br>

			 

			Sharpen your professional skills<br><br>

			Serving on a board will enable you to strengthen a variety of professional skills, which are highly beneficial for career advancement. Key among them is collaboration, particularly how you work and interact with other board members and organizational leaders across business and functional areas that may be newer to you.<br><br>

			 

			You also may hone your ability to contribute to an organization’s strategic direction, rather than managing day-to-day operations. Boards help to guide an organization broadly, such as improving its financial health or market competitiveness. You may be involved in organizational investments, performance evaluation, program funding and policy creation. This is a great step up if your career-to-date has been focused on overseeing a single functional area like finance, marketing or operations.<br><br>

			 

			Serving on a board will also strengthen leadership skills, especially if you are heading a committee of other executives, which is quite different than leading a team of direct reports or a cross-functional project team. And, if the committee meets remotely, directing them can also sharpen remote team management skills.<br><br>

			 

			A board position may also provide you with an opportunity to coach and mentor others, including members of the organization’s management team or junior board colleagues. In addition, specific training or certifications may be required as part of your board commitment. This will add to your professional wheelhouse and can be beneficial as you advance your career in any capacity.<br><br>

			 

			Gain exposure and insight<br><br>

			Serving on a board provides access to the inner workings of an organization, as well as the opportunity to learn about other industries, business strategies and markets from an insider’s perspective. This exposure enhances your marketability and can be especially beneficial if you choose to pursue a role in a different industry or want to transition to a non-profit organization. If you are serving on a non-profit board, the role can lay the groundwork for potential leadership positions in that organization or similar ones in the future.<br><br>

			 

			Reinvigorate your career<br><br>

			You can use your expertise and skills as a board member to make a difference in a company, industry, community, and possibly, in a lot of individual lives – especially if you work with a non-profit organization. And collaborating with and mentoring passionate and motivated people can also be invigorating. The resulting inspiration, connection and engagement can motivate and propel you to take your career to the next level.<br><br>

			 

			Increased visibility<br><br>

			Exhibiting solid performance on a board and utilizing your expertise to contribute meaningfully to its mission and goals will elevate your professional reputation. You will be seen as a dedicated, strategic, go-to person with great insight who gets things done. Your visibility and value within the organization and with stakeholders and other business leaders will grow. These leaders, as well as your board colleagues, will know the benefits of working with you firsthand, which can be to your advantage as you pursue future board roles or employment opportunities.<br><br>

			 

			Serving on a board is a great way to expand your career experience, whether you’re helping a non-profit organization or a corporate entity. It will provide you with opportunities to broaden and sharpen skills, grow your professional network and gain exposure to new industries and areas of business that will drive professional growth. Joining a board will help you elevate your reputation and strengthen your personal brand, which are key elements to fuel career advancement.<br><br>

			<li id="blog3" class="bloglist"> <h2>Your Donor-Centered Appeal Letter Checklist</h2> </li>

			<p id="blog2" class="blog">  Last fall BoardAssist launched a junior board matching pilot program to find junior boards for all the terrific millennials who approach us for board service. The pilot was an immediate success with loads of amazing young professionals approaching us for junior board seats. From the nonprofits we helped, the feedback has been extremely positive.  While many were concerned that having a junior board would take a lot of staff time away from other critical functions, what we’ve heard has been wholly to the contrary. Millennials are terrific self-starters that don’t need or want a lot of hand-holding.  Give them a task to do, and they will get it done! <br><br>

			Still on the fence about starting a junior board for your nonprofit? We wrote this post to share with you some of the amazing things our own Young Professionals Board has accomplished for us in their first six months of service.  We couldn’t be more grateful to them for their energy and all they have done.<br><br>

			For advice on managing your junior board with a minimal amount of time, read our Top 9 Tips for Managing Your Junior Board.  And now, read below for details on some of the many ways our own millennial board members have supported BoardAssist.<br><br>

			6 Terrific Ways our Young Professionals Board (YPB) has Supported Us<br><br>
			 

			1. Google AdWords<br><br>

			As most nonprofits now know, Google generously gives qualifying nonprofits up to $120,000 a year to spend in free advertising.  But spending this free ad money is not easy unless you really know your way around Google AdWords.  For many smaller nonprofits like BoardAssist, that don’t have large social media and tech teams, figuring our how to use this money proves challenging, and its disheartening to leave this valuable gift unspent. BoardAssist’s YPB took on the task of spending this money for us with creative and well-placed ads and we are now spending a much higher percentage of the money allocated to us.  In the last 30 days, Adwords accounted for 12% of sessions on the BoardAssist site, a major jump thanks to the YPB.<br><br>

			Are you a charity that offers free music education to inner city kids?  Maybe placing your ads so that buyers of orchestra tickets can find them would be a good idea?  Or placing ads near sports tickets sales if you are a youth sports nonprofit?  We don’t profess to have the answers, but our hunch is your new junior board would.<br><br>

			2.  Search Engine Optimization (SEO)<br><br>

			One of the first things our YPB organized for us was a free SEO audit.  We thought we understood how SEO worked, and mistakenly thought how quickly folks found us online was largely about having certain keywords and tags on our website.  In fact, the SEO audit identified a number of new and interesting ways for us to improve our sites’s visibility, almost all having to do with things we should be doing unrelated to our site.<br><br>

			3.  Sourcing Generous Donations<br><br>

			Without even being asked, our YPB has sourced a number of terrific donations for BoardAssist.  One YPB member sourced free digital advertising for us with two major publications worth over $10,000.  Another one arranged for free printing of our signature book on board service, Giving Back.<br><br>

			4.  Helping us Communicate in the year 2016<br><br>

			Getting your nonprofit’s message out in 2016 requires a completely different set of skills and communications techniques than it did in 2006 or 1996.  In addition to being on top of the latest social media trends, basic document production needs to be different.  Operating a nonprofit in 2016 means knowing how to communicate with images as much as with words. Our YPB has updated a number of documents in our board recruiting arsenal to make them more user friendly and replaced heavy text with more images.<br><br>

			5.  Recruiting for our own Young Professionals Board and Raising our Visibility Generally<br><br>

			Millennials are terrific at networking and team-building.  Our YPB grew themselves from zero to 12 professionals in no time flat.  While BoardAssist initially sourced candidate ideas for the team, our YPB interviewed and successfully closed these candidates wholly on their own. They also organized from start to finish several social events promoting BoardAssist – from finding spaces to host events for free, and creating and distributing Paperless Post invitations, to creating buzz for the events through multiple social media outlets, all at no cost to BoardAssist of staff time or money.  YPB events have all been 100% self funding.<br><br>

			6. Creating Valuable New Partnerships<br><br>

			One of the top priorities for our YPB is finding more folks who want to serve on junior boards for our clients.  YPB members have been working enthusiastically to set up partnerships with the schools they attended and companies they work at to do just that. Millennials excel at collaborating.  Putting that skill to work for BoardAssist has been terrific.<br><br>

			 
			What are you waiting for?  Let BoardAssist help you build your own junior board.  If yours is half as productive and energetic as ours has been, you will be very pleased indeed.  <br><br>

			A final note:  while BoardAssist’s YPB is not engaged in fundraising for BoardAssist (as we don’t ask this of them), most junior boards are very involved in fundraising and enormously successful at it.<br><br>
